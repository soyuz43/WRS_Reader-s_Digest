    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError("Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?") from exc
    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
